# Fermat's Test

Fermat's Little Theorem allows us to prove that a number is composite without actually factoring it.

````{prf:theorem} Euler's theorem
If $(a, n) = 1$ then

```{math}
a^{\phi(n)} \equiv 1 \text{ mod } n
```
````

````{prf:corollary} Fermat's Little Theorem
If $p$ is prime and $(p, a) = 1$ then

```{math}
a^{p - 1} \equiv 1 \text{ mod } p
```
