# Prelimnaries

Some **intro Markdown**!

Simply put, A prime is a positive integer p having exactly two positive
divisors, namely 1 and p. An integer n is composite if n > 1 and n is not
prime. (The number 1 is considered neither prime nor composite.) Thus,
an integer n is composite if and only if it admits a nontrivial factorization
n = ab, where a, b are integers, each strictly between 1 and n. Though the
definition of primality is exquisitely simple, the resulting sequence 2, 3, 5, 7,...
of primes will be the highly nontrivial collective object of our attention. The
wonderful properties, known results, and open conjectures pertaining to the
primes are manifold. We shall cover some of what we believe to be theoretically
interesting, aesthetic, and practical aspects of the primes. Along the way,
we also address the essential problem of factorization of composites, a field
inextricably entwined with the study of the primes themselves.
In the remainder of this chapter we shall introduce our cast of characters,
the primes themselves, and some of the lore that surrounds them.
