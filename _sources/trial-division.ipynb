    "\n",
    "Given an integer $n$, the trial division consists of sequentially testing whether $n$ is divisible by any smaller number. Clearly, it is only worthwhile to test factors less than $n$, and in order from two upwards (since two is the first prime number). With this ordering, there is no point in testing for divisibility by four if the number has already been determined not divisible by two, and so on for three and any multiple of three, etc. Therefore, the effort can be reduced by selecting only prime numbers as test divisors. Furthermore, the test divisors need go no further than $\\sqrt {n}$ because, if $n$ is divisible by some number $p$, then $n = p \\times q$ and if $q$ were smaller than $p$, $n$ would have been detected earlier as being divisible by $q$ or by a prime factor of $q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can augment trial division test to do primality testing as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Factor $n$ using trial division test. $n$ is prime if and only if none of the trial divisors divides n.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not necessary that the trial divisors be all primes. To speed things up, however we may exploit the fact that after 2, we can skip the other even numbers. So, 2 and the odd numbers may be used as trial divisors.\n",

    "## Divisibility Test\n",
    "\n",
    "A divisibility test is a procedure applied to a number $n$ so as to determine whether $n$ is divisible by a particular small number or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "From a computational point of view, checking if $n$ is divisible by a number $p$ can be achieved by dividing $n$ by $p$ and getting the quotient and remainder. For remainder being 0, the number is said to be divisible and $p$ is said to be a *factor* of $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trial Division** is the most laborious but easiest to understand of the integer factorization algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We sequentially check whether *n* is divisible or not by the members of the set of trial divisors for *n*. \n",
    " <!--TODO: FIXME:  -->\n",

    "It is not necessary that the trial divisors be all primes. To speed things up, however we may exploit the fact that after 2, we can skip the other even numbers. So, 2 and the odd numbers may be used as trial divisors."
